OMG, just finished Borderline and let me tell you, what the actual heck did I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩?! Like, seriously, the cinematography was just... wow. You ever 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 something and go, Did they plan that, or is it just accidental genius? That was the whole vibe. The lighting was insane, kind of like they threw a party in every shot. Shadows doing a dance-off with the actors, haha. It was like a crazy visual trip, you know what I mean?

The plot though, omg, I can’t even. So much happening and yet... not a lot happening? You know, sometimes I just wanna shout at the screen, like, Can you guys just chill and explain for five secs?! But that’s what makes the   kinda addictive, I guess. The characters were doing these emotional acrobatics, like how do you keep up with that pace? I think I need a nap or a challenge for my brain cells, hmmmm.

I actually had to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   before 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 it 'cause my WiFi is acting like it’s from the Stone Age. Gotta respect the hustle of dodgy internet, lol. But seriously, halfway through, I was just munching on my popcorn like it was gonna solve the plot puzzles for me. It didn’t, but eh, worth a try. You ever do that, just rely on popcorn magic? 😂

> And those camera angles... dude, some of them looked like they were 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮ing from Mars or something. I mean, who thinks of these ideas?! That scene overlooking the city, where it looked like the buildings were about to start singing, was just pure art. Makes me wanna pick up a camera and just start shooting random stuff, who knows, maybe I'll capture some accidental brilliance too. 🤷‍♂️

So, I guess the ending was... an ending? Like it ended, but did it really end, you know? It left me with more questions than a philosophy textbook. Maybe the director was like, Let's keep them hanging like 𝘴𝘦𝘢𝘴𝘰𝘯 finales. Ha! Did I get it right, or am I just losing it even more than usual? Anyway, gotta recover from this cinematic rollercoaster.

console.log(I have no clue why this code is here, but hey, it's here.);

Ugh, why do I always feel like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨  s is an emotional cardio session? Anyway, what's up with you? Planning to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   at some point? I've got snacks if you're down for round two, just let me know! 😄
